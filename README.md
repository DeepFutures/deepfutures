# deepfutures
DeepFutures is an open source futures transaction prediction tool that applies reinforcement learning techniques with RNN and MCTS. The project currently based on TensorFlow and Python.

DeepFutures is currently being developed by students from Santa Clara University as a course project for COEN 281 Pattern Recognition & Data Mining. In the future, it will be improved, maintained and expanded into a general framework for financial applications.

If you want to contribute to the project, please contact current members, thank you!
