# deepfutures
DeepFutures is an open source futures transaction prediction tool that applies reinforcement learning techniques with DNN and MCTS. The project currently based on TensorFlow and Python.

We use Issues to track request and bugs.

If you want to contribute to the project, please contact current members, thank you!

## Requirements

1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Tensorflow
3. Pandas
4. Numpy

## Demo Run

main.ipynb contains the demo for the current 0.1 version.

The result of MCTS has not been used to train DNN yet, due to the limit of computation resources.

In next version, the DNN training module will be add, to form a complete reinforcment learning pipeline.
